# Advent of code
This is a repository used to help promoting daily routine of coding. To reiginite the spark that died with day to day office work. 

## Language of choice
I want to make use of learning language through AoC, as it seems as fun but challenging challenge i put up myself. Do i expect to commit to all problems successfully? No, but if i cant complete i do have a secondary goal of giving a failed attempt and if time allows i will write in language i know.
My language of choice i want to learn is **JavaScript**. I was neglecting this language for too long. I dont believe it is a job giver, but its a tool that will help with different use cases and tool making.
Bash and Powershell might be just for the fun of challenge itself. If challenge goes south i will commit to a language i feel most comfortable (Python) 
## Editors
I will commit to using VSC as its piece of software i am not fan of, yet it is loved. I want to understand why. VIM is my terminal of choice, as i started getting rusty. PowerShell ISE for powershell, it just works. Pycharm purely for python. Comfy choice of IDE.
